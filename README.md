# Final Flight
## An infinite trench run game!
NOTE: This repo is a clone of my original [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/nps23/final-flight), which has a full commit history. I ported that one here to consolidate.

Welcome to the Simulator! This is is the first game I build using the Unity Game engine. The game is written in C#, and feautres a fully animated opening cutscene, a main menu, and a tutorial. The same is an infinite Star Wars esque trench run, where the goal is to make it as far as possible. In general, the furhter you go, the faster your ship will get. You'll have to either shoot or avoid obstacles to keep going. The more obstacles you shoot, the faster your ship will go. Have fun!

Ready-to-play binaries can be downloaded from the [itch.io page](https://nps23.itch.io/final-flight).
